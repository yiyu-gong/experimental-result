# Running Environment

## I. Experimental Platform
Our experiments are conducted on a high-performance system with the following specifications:
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04
- **Python Version**: 3.10.6
- **OCaml**: 4.11.0
- **Z3 Solver**: 4.8.12
## II. Project Directory Description

### 1. Benchmark
- **bench-origin**
  - The benchmarks used in this project are sourced from the public repository [https://github.com/kind2-mc/kind2-benchmarks](https://github.com/kind2-mc/kind2-benchmarks).
  - Given that our method primarily aims to optimize the verification process by reusing constraint-solving information to enhance efficiency, we selectively excluded instances with \(K = 1\) from the Kind2 benchmark suite. Such instances have a low frequency of solver calls and thus do not fully demonstrate the advantages of our approach. Additionally, we removed instances of the `real` type, as their solving time is relatively minor, with the majority of time spent on quantifier elimination, which is not representative for evaluating our method. After careful selection, we finalized a total of 701 test cases to constitute the experimental test suite, thereby ensuring the accuracy and validity of the evaluation results.

- **bench-location**
  - These benchmarks are located in the `/kind2-benchmarks-master/` directory. The `/supplement/benchmark.csv` file indexes the paths of the 701 relevant files, facilitating access and utilization of the benchmark data.

- **`IC3_origin`**: The default configuration of the IC3 algorithm in Kind2.
- **`IC3_CS`**: The IC3 acceleration verification algorithm utilizing constraint-solving information reuse, which includes reusing UNSAT cores and satisfiable models.
- **`IC3_UC`**: The IC3 acceleration verification algorithm focusing on the reuse of UNSAT cores.

### 3. Scripts
Python scripts used in our experiments:
- **runIC3_origin.py**: Executes the IC3_origin binary on the benchmarks contained in `kind2-benchmarks-master`.
